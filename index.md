## Questions & Answers

### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

My domain involved analyzing bank transaction data and exploring credit risk. The most interesting topic covered this quarter is using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to predict transaction categories. LLMs stand out due to their exceptional ability to handle complex natural language processing (NLP) problems, which are difficult for traditional machine learning techniques. Their versatility and potential applications in financial data analysis are fascinating, and I’m excited about exploring their capabilities further.

### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

For Quarter 2, I would like to explore more **NLP techniques** to analyze bank transaction data and enhance credit risk assessment. Current credit scoring systems, such as those developed by FICO, do not adequately incorporate users' demographic information or spending behaviors. My investigation would aim to design a better solution for assessing credit risk, potentially uncovering new insights by integrating NLP models to evaluate transaction patterns and consumer habits.

### **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

Currently, my group develops models and implementations using **Jupyter Notebooks**, which, while convenient, hinder reproducibility and scalability for long-term projects. To address this, I would switch to using modular **Python (.py) scripts** and follow best practices for project development, including proper documentation, version control, and testing frameworks. This would improve the reproducibility and maintainability of our work, especially when collaborating in a team environment.

### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

In my **CSE158** class, I learned about the **latent-factor model**, which is commonly used in recommendation systems. I am interested in exploring whether this technique could be applied to my domain. Specifically, I want to investigate if latent-factor models can uncover hidden customer relationships or behavioral patterns in transaction data, providing deeper insights into credit risk or spending behaviors.
